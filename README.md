The Application will list survey questions with options and correct answer. For the time being I have hardcoded survey questions and answers.

The API will expose survey API in REST using Java and Spring Boot.

Application Start up - Open RestapiApplication.java ,right click and run application.

Once the application is started,Api can be accessed in below url 
http://localhost:8080/surveys/Survey1/questions/

Please use JSON viewer for better view - http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/
